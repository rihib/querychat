		"Present your recommendation in JSON, using lowercase keys 'type', 'x', and 'y'. " +
		"Use an empty string for non-applicable choices.\n" +
		"  Ensure the JSON data:\n" +
		"    - Is clear and concise.\n" +
		"    - Is enclosed within triple backticks (```) and prefixed with 'json'.\n" +
		"  Example JSON data format:\n" +
		"    ```json\n" +
		"    {\"type\": \"bar\", \"x\": \"SaleMonth\", \"y\": \"TotalSales\"}\n" +
		"    ```\n" +
		"\n" +
		"Note: \n" +
		"  - Clearly demarcate the SQL query and JSON data.\n" +
		"  - Adhere strictly to JSON formatting standards.\n" +
		"  - The schema is provided for context.\n"
